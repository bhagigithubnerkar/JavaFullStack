to handle the runtime errors.

Types:
a) Built-In Exception
1. Checked Exception
            - compile time exception
            - IOException, SQLException
2. Unchecked Exception
            - run tme exception

Error:
   - irrecoverable


   Throwable
            - Exception
                     - IOException
                     - SQLException
                     - ClassNotFoundException
                     - FileNotFoundException
                     - RuntimeException
                              - ArithmeticException
                              - NullPointerException
                              - IndexOutOfBoundException
                              - NumberFormatException

 - Error
          - StackOverFlowError
          - OutOfMemoryError
          - VirtualMachineError

Reasons for exceptions:
1. Invalid user input
2. Network connection error
3. Out of memory

1. try
       - Place an exception code.
       - Must be followed by either catch or finally

2. catch
       - Handle the exception
       - Without try not allow

3. finally
       - to execute code like closing the connection
       - always executed whether exception is handled or not
       - eg. closing the file,closing database connection
       - only one finally block

4. throw
       - to throw an exception explicitly
       - can throw either checked or unchecked exception

5. throws
       - declare the exception
       - suppress the exception



Difference between final & finally
      final                                               finally                                   finalize
1.It is the keyword & access modifier.            1. It is the block in Exception Handling.        1.It is the method which is used to perform  clean up
                                                                                                     processing just before object is garbage collected

2.Used to apply restrictions on a class,          2.Checks whether the exception occurs or not.    2.finalize() method is used with the objects
method or variable.

3.It is applicable to classes,methods and         3.It is related to the try and catch block in    3.To perform cleaning activities with respect to
  variables.                                         exception handling                               the object before its destruction          .                                      exception handling.

4.Once declared,final variable becomes            4.finally block runs code even if exception      4.It is executed just before the object is
constant & cannot be modified.                      occurs or not.                                   destroyed.

5.final method cannot be overridden by            5.finally block clean up all resources used in
sub class.                                           try block.

6.final class cannot be inherited.                6.finally block is executed when try-catch block
                                                    is executed.

7.final method is executed only when
 we call it.


Difference between throw & throws
         throw                                    throws
1. used to throw an exception                   1.declare the exception
explicitly

2.can only propagate unchecked                 2.can used to propagate both checked &
exception                                        unchecked exception

3.within the method                            3. with the method signature

4.cannot throw multiple exceptions             4.declare multiple exceptions using throws keyword

5.eg. NullPointerException,Arithmetic          5.eg. main() throws IO Exception,SQl Exception
  Exception

Nested Try :
- try inside another try
- Sometimes a situation may arise where part of a block may
cause one error and the entire block itself may cause another error.
In such cases exception handlers have to be nested.

Exception Propagation:
- When an exception occurs within a method then if that method does
not handle that exception object.
- Will be propagated to caller than the call method is responsible
that exception
- An exception is thrown from the top of the stack & if it not caught,
then it drops down the call stack
