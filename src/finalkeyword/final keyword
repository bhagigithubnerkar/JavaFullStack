1. variable:
          - cannot chnage the value of final variable
          - stop value change

blank final variable:
          - not initialised at the time of declaration
          - only in constructor we can initialized blank final variable.

static blank final variable:
          - not initialised at the time of declaration
          - only in static block we can initialized static blank final variable

2. method
         - method cannot be overridden

3. class
        - cannot extend final class

Que.why do we need final keyword?
Ans: The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes,attributes & methods,
which makes them non-changeable.It is useful when we want a variable always store the same value.
It is a modifier.The value assignment can be done only once.We can assign the value upon final
instance variable declaration,in the instance initializer block or in the constructor.

Que. why a constructor can not be final in java?
Ans: Because it inherently it cannot be modified. Also,a java constructor is internally final.
So again there is no need for final declaration further.
Constructors cannot be inherited in java.
