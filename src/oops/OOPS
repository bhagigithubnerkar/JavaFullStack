 OOPS Concepts:
 Object Oriented Programming
      eg. Java,C#,PHP,Python,C++
 To implement real world entities.


 1. Object:
  Real world entity.
       eg. Pen,Computer,Laptop,Mobile,Table,Chair,etc.
  instance of class
  can be physical or logical
  contains an address so it consumes memory
  has states & behaviour
         eg. a) Dog
                     states: color,name,breed
                     behaviours: barking,eating,walking,running
             b) Mobile
                      states: color,name,display,weight,OS,RAM,Camera
                      behaviours: calling,Video,playing,ringing,vibrate
             c)Pen
                     states: color,name,brand,height,type
                     behaviours: writing

  2.Class
  Collection of objects.
  logical entity
  blueprint
  doesn't consume any space

  3. Inheritance
  When one object acquires all the properties(states)and behaviours of parent object

  4. Polymorphism
  One task is performed in different ways
         eg. Cat speaks meow
             Dog barks woof

  5. Abstraction
   Hiding internal details & showing only functionality to the end users.
         eg. Washing machine,Microwave Oven

   6. Encapsulation
   Binding or wrapping code & data together into a single unit.

Que. Find which is the first OOP language?  Simula
Que. Find which is the first truly OOP language? Smalltalk

   7. Aggregation
   if a class have an entity reference in it
   represents HAS-A relationship
   code re-usability
